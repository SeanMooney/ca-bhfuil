## Project Identity

**Name**: C√° Bhfuil *(pronounced "caw will")*  
**Meaning**: Irish for "where is" - capturing the tool's core purpose  
**License**: MIT License  
**Project Type**: Hobby project for open source maintainers  
**Development Model**: Single developer + AI assistance

## Technical Vision

**C√° Bhfuil is a pragmatic git repository analysis tool that helps open source maintainers track patches, fixes, and features across their stable branches.**

Built by a developer, for developers who maintain complex git repositories with multiple stable branches and need to quickly understand where changes have landed and what still needs backporting.

## Core Problem Statement

### The Open Source Maintainer Pain

Open source project maintainers face these daily challenges:

- **Backport Management**: "Did CVE-2024-1234 get backported to all supported stable branches?"
- **Fix Tracking**: "Where is the fix for this memory leak across our release branches?"
- **Release Planning**: "What fixes are in main but missing from stable/v2.1?"
- **Change Archaeology**: "When was this feature added and is it safe to backport?"
- **Compliance Auditing**: "Show me all security fixes that need backporting"

### Why Git CLI Isn't Enough

The git CLI is powerful but requires complex command chains and deep knowledge:
```bash
# To find where a commit exists across branches
git branch --contains <sha>
git tag --contains <sha>
git log --grep="CVE-2024-1234" --all --oneline
git cherry -v stable/v2.1 main | grep <sha>
```

This becomes unwieldy when tracking multiple changes across many branches, especially when dealing with:
- Cherry-picked commits with different SHAs
- Gerrit Change-IDs that span multiple commits
- Issue tracker references scattered across commit messages
- Understanding what changes are still pending backport

## Solution Architecture

### Core Capabilities

#### 1. **Universal Change Tracking** üîç
Input any reference and find all related commits:
```bash
ca-bhfuil "CVE-2024-1234"           # Find security fixes
ca-bhfuil I1a2b3c4d5e6f7g8h9i0j     # Gerrit Change-ID
ca-bhfuil abc123def                 # Git SHA (full or partial)
ca-bhfuil "LP#1234567"              # Launchpad bug
ca-bhfuil "memory leak in auth"     # Natural language search
```

#### 2. **Branch Distribution Analysis** üå≥
Understand where changes exist across your branching strategy:
- Detect all branches containing specific commits
- Identify cherry-picks and backports (same Change-ID, different SHA)
- Map commits to release tags and stable branches
- Show what's missing from each stable branch

#### 3. **Backport Status Tracking** üìã
Critical for stable branch maintenance:
- Compare main branch against stable branches
- Identify commits that need backporting
- Detect failed cherry-picks and conflicts
- Track which fixes made it to which releases

#### 4. **AI-Assisted Understanding** üß†
Leverage AI to make sense of complex change histories:
- Summarize what commits actually changed
- Classify changes (bugfix, feature, security, etc.)
- Identify related commits (fixes, reverts, follow-ups)
- Extract issue tracker references and context

### Technical Implementation

#### **Performance First Design**
Built for large repositories with local-first storage and offline capability:
- **pygit2**: LibGit2 bindings for 10x+ performance over GitPython
- **SQLite-based Persistence**: All caching and data storage using file-based SQLite
- **Offline-First**: Complete functionality without network dependencies
- **diskcache**: SQLite-backed caching with automatic eviction and persistence
- **File-based RAG**: Local vector storage for AI-enhanced search without external databases

#### **AI Integration Strategy**
Local-first AI approach designed for privacy and independence:
- **Primary**: Ollama/vLLM/LMStudio for local model hosting
- **OpenAI-Compatible Interface**: Unified API for all providers (local and remote)
- **Provider-Agnostic**: Support any OpenAI-compatible endpoint
- **Small Model Optimization**: Designed to work with 7B-13B parameter models
- **Privacy First**: Local providers keep repository analysis private
- **Remote Fallback**: OpenRouter integration for enhanced analysis (optional)
- **Structured Output**: Pydantic models ensure reliable responses from all providers
- **Graceful Degradation**: Core functionality works without AI entirely

#### **Issue Tracker Integration**
Support for common open source trackers:
- **Primary**: GitHub Issues, Launchpad, JIRA
- **Secondary**: Gerrit (Change-ID parsing), Bugzilla
- **Pattern Matching**: Regex-based extraction from commit messages
- **Lazy Resolution**: Show links immediately, fetch content on demand

## User Experience Design

### Target User: Open Source Maintainer

**Primary Workflow**: Stable branch maintenance and release management
- Maintain multiple stable branches (e.g., stable/v2.1, stable/v2.0)
- Track security fixes and critical bugs across branches
- Prepare release notes and understand change impact
- Coordinate with contributors on backport requests

### Interaction Patterns

#### **Quick Status Checks**
```bash
# What's the status of this CVE across all branches?
ca-bhfuil "CVE-2024-1234"

# What commits are in main but not in stable/v2.1?
ca-bhfuil --missing-from stable/v2.1

# Where did this commit land?
ca-bhfuil abc123def --distribution
```

#### **Release Preparation**
```bash
# What changed between these tags?
ca-bhfuil --range v2.1.0..v2.1.1 --categorize

# Show all security fixes since last release
ca-bhfuil --security --since v2.1.0

# Generate backport candidate list
ca-bhfuil --backport-candidates stable/v2.1
```

#### **Investigation Mode**
```bash
# Interactive exploration for complex tracking
ca-bhfuil --interactive
> search: authentication memory leak
> analyze: impact and related changes
> backport: check stable branch status
> export: generate report for security team
```

### Output Design Philosophy

## Technical Risks & Mitigations

### Repository Scale Challenges
- **Risk**: Performance degradation on massive repositories
- **Mitigation**: Aggressive caching, pygit2 performance, incremental analysis

### Local-First Data Architecture

#### **File-Based Storage Philosophy**
C√° Bhfuil embraces simplicity and independence through file-based storage:

**SQLite as the Primary Backend**
- **Repository Analysis Cache**: Commit metadata, branch relationships, and analysis results
- **Issue Tracker Cache**: API responses and link resolutions stored locally
- **AI Context Storage**: RAG embeddings and analysis history in SQLite with extensions
- **Configuration Management**: User preferences and tool configuration

**No External Dependencies**
- **Zero Database Administration**: No PostgreSQL, MySQL, or Redis required
- **Portable Data**: Entire cache and configuration travels with the repository
- **Version Control Friendly**: Cache databases can be excluded from git with .gitignore
- **Backup Simplicity**: Copy files to backup entire application state

**Offline-First Design**
- **Complete Functionality**: Full repository analysis without network access
- **Cached AI Models**: Local Ollama/vLLM models work offline
- **Persistent Context**: RAG embeddings stored locally for enhanced search
- **Graceful Degradation**: Issue tracker links shown even when APIs unavailable

#### **RAG Storage Strategy**
Local Retrieval Augmented Generation without external vector databases:

**SQLite Vector Extensions**
- **sqlite-vec**: Vector similarity search directly in SQLite
- **Embedding Storage**: Commit message and change embeddings stored locally
- **Efficient Retrieval**: Fast semantic search through repository history
- **Incremental Updates**: Only embed new commits, reuse existing embeddings

**Local Embedding Models**
- **Provider-Hosted Embeddings**: Use embedding models from configured LLM provider (Ollama, vLLM, LMStudio, OpenRouter)
- **OpenAI-Compatible API**: Unified interface for embeddings regardless of provider
- **Repository-Specific**: Build embeddings corpus from actual commit history
- **Privacy Preserving**: Embeddings generated by local providers maintain privacy
- **Network Optional**: Local providers work offline, remote providers require network

#### **Cache Architecture**
Intelligent local caching for performance and offline capability:

**Hierarchical Storage**
```
~/.cache/ca-bhfuil/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ repos/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ {repo-hash}/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ analysis.db          # SQLite: commit analysis, branch data
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ embeddings.db        # SQLite: RAG vectors from provider APIs
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ trackers.db          # SQLite: cached issue tracker data
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ config.db            # SQLite: repo-specific configuration
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ global/
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ providers.yaml       # AI provider configurations
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ templates.db         # SQLite: reusable analysis templates
```

**Smart Cache Management**
- **Automatic Eviction**: LRU eviction with configurable size limits
- **Partial Updates**: Only refresh changed branches/commits
- **Cross-Repository Sharing**: Common patterns shared across repos
- **Configurable TTLs**: Different expiration for analysis vs. tracker data

#### **Local-First AI Design**
C√° Bhfuil is built with privacy and local control as primary concerns:

**Primary Mode: Provider-Hosted Models**
- **Ollama Integration**: Primary backend for running LLM and embedding models locally
- **vLLM Support**: High-performance inference server for local network deployment
- **LMStudio Compatibility**: Desktop AI model hosting with OpenAI-compatible API
- **OpenRouter Support**: Remote hosted models with OpenAI-compatible interface
- **Unified Interface**: Single OpenAI-compatible client for all providers

**Structured Prompting for Small Models**
- **Constrained Output**: Pydantic schemas ensure reliable responses from smaller models
- **Context Optimization**: Efficient prompts designed for limited context windows
- **Task Specialization**: Separate small models for different analysis tasks rather than one large model

**Optional Cloud Enhancement**
- **OpenRouter Integration**: Optional fallback for complex analysis requiring larger models
- **Explicit Opt-in**: Cloud usage requires explicit configuration and user consent
- **Selective Usage**: Only non-sensitive summarization tasks, never raw repository content

**Privacy Guarantees**
- **Provider Choice**: User controls whether to use local or remote providers
- **No Model Execution**: C√° Bhfuil doesn't run models directly, only calls APIs
- **Metadata Only**: AI analysis works with commit messages and metadata, not source code
- **Configurable Boundaries**: Clear controls over what data is sent to which provider endpoint

### Issue Tracker API Limitations
- **Risk**: Rate limiting and authentication complexity
- **Mitigation**: Lazy loading, aggressive caching, graceful degradation

### Operational Complexity
- **Risk**: Complex setup and configuration requirements
- **Mitigation**: File-based storage, zero external dependencies, automatic cache management
- **Risk**: Performance degradation with large cache files
- **Mitigation**: SQLite optimization, automatic cleanup, configurable retention policies
