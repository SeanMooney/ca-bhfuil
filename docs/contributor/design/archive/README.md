# Design Documents Archive

This directory contains the original design documents that were restructured in **2025-06-25** to eliminate duplication and improve focus.

## Migration Summary

The original documents contained significant duplication and overlapping concerns. They have been restructured into focused, single-topic documents:

### Original Documents (Archived)
- `ci-design.md` - CI/CD strategy and implementation
- `cli-design.md` - CLI design patterns and conventions  
- `git-repository-management.md` - Git repository management system
- `packaging.md` - Container packaging strategy
- `project-vision.md` - Project vision and technical architecture
- `repository-structure.md` - Repository organization guide
- `technology-stack.md` - Technology choices and rationale

### New Focused Documents (../*)
- `architecture-overview.md` - High-level system architecture
- `technology-decisions.md` - Technology choice rationale
- `cli-design-patterns.md` - CLI design principles and conventions
- `data-storage-design.md` - Storage architecture and data management
- `repository-management.md` - Git repository operations
- `development-workflow.md` - Development process and tooling
- `project-vision.md` - Product vision and goals (rewritten)

## Content Migration

Each section of content was carefully extracted and consolidated to eliminate duplication while preserving all technical decisions and rationale. The new documents provide:

- **Single source of truth** for each topic
- **Clear scope boundaries** between documents  
- **Cross-references** instead of duplication
- **Focused content** for specific technical areas

## Historical Reference

These archived documents remain available for historical reference and to understand the evolution of the project's technical design decisions.
