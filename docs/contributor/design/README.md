## Design Principles

### Single Responsibility
Each document covers one aspect of the system thoroughly without duplication.

### Clear Scope
Every document has explicit boundaries defining what it covers and what it doesn't.

### Cross-References
Related information is linked rather than duplicated across documents.

### Focused Audience
Each document is written for specific roles and use cases.

## Historical Documents

Previous design documents have been archived in the **[archive/](archive/)** directory with a comprehensive migration guide. These documents contained significant duplication and overlapping concerns that have been resolved in the current structure.

## Maintenance

### Document Updates
- Update documents individually when changes affect their specific scope
- Use cross-references to avoid duplication
- Maintain consistency in terminology across documents

### Review Process
- Monthly review of document accuracy and completeness
- Quarterly review of document structure and relationships
- Update cross-references when documents are restructured
