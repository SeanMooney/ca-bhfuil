# Concurrency Architecture

> **Async/await patterns for concurrent git repository analysis**

## System Overview

Ca-Bhfuil's concurrency architecture enables efficient processing of multiple repositories simultaneously while maintaining responsive user interfaces. The design prioritizes async-first patterns with careful resource management for single-developer maintenance.

## Core Architectural Principles

### Async-First Design
- **I/O Operations**: All file, network, and database operations use async/await
- **Git Operations**: Thread pool wrappers for synchronous pygit2 calls
- **Progress Reporting**: Real-time updates through async queues
- **Resource Management**: Semaphores and connection pooling

### Concurrency Control Strategy
- **Repository Processing**: 3-5 concurrent repositories (configurable)
- **Network Operations**: Rate-limited HTTP clients with connection pooling
- **Database Access**: Connection pooling with transaction management
- **Git Operations**: Thread pool isolation for pygit2 synchronous operations

### Performance and Responsiveness
- **Non-blocking CLI**: Operations remain responsive during long tasks
- **Background Processing**: Data prefetching and analysis tasks
- **Progress Transparency**: Real-time progress bars and status updates
- **Efficient Resource Usage**: Connection reuse and intelligent caching

## System Components

## Background Task Architecture

### Task Management Strategy

**Task Lifecycle Management**

## Integration with Ca-Bhfuil Architecture

This concurrency design integrates with the broader system architecture:
- **Local-First**: All async operations work offline with local storage
- **Performance-Focused**: Designed for repositories with 10k+ commits
- **Privacy-Preserving**: Async operations maintain local-only data handling
- **Modular Design**: Async components integrate cleanly with existing architecture

**Implementation Note (2025-06-27):** The foundational async infrastructure, as detailed in `ai/memory/async-conversion-tasks.md`, has been implemented. This includes the core async managers, I/O handlers, and the CLI bridge. The next step is to integrate these components into the application's feature logic.
