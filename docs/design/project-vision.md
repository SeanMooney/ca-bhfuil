# Ca-Bhfuil Project Vision

> **Product vision, user goals, and success metrics**

## Project Identity

**Name**: Cá Bhfuil *(pronounced "caw will")*  
**Meaning**: Irish for "where is?" - capturing the tool's core purpose  
**License**: MIT License  
**Target Users**: Open source maintainers managing complex git repositories

## Vision Statement

**Cá Bhfuil helps open source maintainers answer "where is my fix?" across complex git histories with multiple stable branches.**

Built by a developer who understands the daily challenges of tracking patches, security fixes, and features across stable release branches in large open source projects.

## Problem Statement

### The Open Source Maintainer Challenge

Open source project maintainers face these daily frustrations:

**Backport Management Pain**:
- "Did CVE-2024-1234 get backported to all supported stable branches?"
- "Which stable branches are missing this critical memory leak fix?"
- "What security fixes do we need for the next LTS release?"

**Release Planning Complexity**:
- "What changed between stable/v2.1 and stable/v2.2?"
- "Show me all fixes that are in main but missing from stable/v2.1"
- "Which commits need backporting for the next security release?"

**Change Archaeology**:
- "When was this authentication feature added and is it safe to backport?"
- "Find all commits related to this CVE across our entire git history"
- "What are the dependencies for backporting this feature?"

### Why Existing Tools Fall Short

**Git CLI Complexity**:
```bash
# Current workflow requires complex command chains
git branch --contains <sha>
git tag --contains <sha>  
git log --grep="CVE-2024-1234" --all --oneline
git cherry -v stable/v2.1 main | grep <sha>
```

**Scaling Problems**:
- Manual processes don't scale to repositories with 50k+ commits
- Complex branching strategies with multiple stable branches
- Cherry-picked commits have different SHAs across branches
- Issue tracker references scattered across commit messages
- Time-consuming manual verification of backport status

**Context Loss**:
- No easy way to understand change impact and relationships
- Difficult to classify changes (security, feature, bugfix)
- Lost knowledge about why changes were made
- No tracking of what still needs backporting

## Solution Vision

### Core User Workflows

#### 1. **Security Fix Tracking** 🔒
```bash
ca-bhfuil "CVE-2024-1234"
```
**Goal**: Instantly see where security fixes have been applied and what's missing

**Output**: Clear visualization of which branches contain the fix, which need it, and backport recommendations

#### 2. **Release Preparation** 📋
```bash
ca-bhfuil --missing-from stable/v2.1 --type security
```
**Goal**: Prepare stable releases with confidence about what fixes are included

**Output**: Comprehensive list of security fixes, features, and changes that need attention

#### 3. **Change Impact Analysis** 🔍
```bash
ca-bhfuil analyze abc123def --impact --related
```
**Goal**: Understand change scope before backporting or planning releases

**Output**: Change classification, impact assessment, and related commits

#### 4. **Cross-Branch Investigation** 🌳
```bash
ca-bhfuil search "memory leak auth" --distribution
```
**Goal**: Find related changes across all branches and understand their distribution

**Output**: Semantic search results with branch distribution and relationship mapping

### User Experience Goals

**Instant Answers**: Common queries answered in seconds, not minutes  
**Visual Clarity**: Rich terminal output that makes relationships obvious  
**Smart Search**: Natural language queries that understand intent  
**Offline Capable**: Full functionality without network dependencies  
**Privacy Preserving**: Repository analysis stays on local machine
