# Data Model Architecture Implementation Plan

> **Implementation plan for applying the Manager + Rich Models architecture from the design document**
>
> **Status**: Active | **Phase**: 1 - Foundation | **Started**: 2025-07-17

## Implementation Overview

This plan implements the Manager + Rich Models architecture from `docs/contributor/design/draft/data-model-architecture.md` to create clean separation between business logic and database persistence while preparing for future AI enhancements.

## Current State Analysis

### ✅ What's Already Implemented

**Business Models** (`src/ca_bhfuil/core/models/`):
- `CommitInfo`: Pure Pydantic business model with git commit data
- `OperationProgress`, `CloneProgress`, `AnalysisProgress`: Progress tracking models  
- `OperationResult`, `CloneResult`, `AnalysisResult`, `SearchResult`: Result models

**Database Models** (`src/ca_bhfuil/storage/database/models.py`):
- Complete SQLModel database schema: `Repository`, `Commit`, `Branch`, `CommitBranch`
- Advanced AI-ready models: `EmbeddingRecord`, `KGNode`, `KGEdge`
- CRUD models: `*Create`, `*Read`, `*Update` variants  
- `TimestampMixin` for automatic timestamp management

**Repository Pattern** (`src/ca_bhfuil/storage/database/repository.py`):
- `BaseRepository` with common database operations
- Specialized repositories: `RepositoryRepository`, `CommitRepository`, `BranchRepository`
- `DatabaseRepository` as aggregator class

**Database Management** (`src/ca_bhfuil/storage/sqlmodel_manager.py`):
- `SQLModelDatabaseManager` handling database operations
- Basic CRUD operations for repositories and commits
- Alembic integration for schema management

**Git Operations** (`src/ca_bhfuil/core/git/repository.py`):
- `Repository` wrapper around pygit2 with comprehensive git operations
- Converts pygit2 objects to `CommitInfo` business models
- Branch discovery, commit searching, repository stats

### ❌ What's Missing (Per Design Document)

**Manager Classes**: No manager classes implementing the Manager + Rich Models pattern

**Enhanced Business Models**: `CommitInfo` lacks:
- Business logic methods (e.g., `matches_pattern`, `calculate_impact_score`)
- Conversion methods (`to_db_create`, `from_db_model`)
- AI-enhanced methods (`get_semantic_content`, `to_kg_properties`)

**Manager Layer**: No orchestration layer between business logic and persistence

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Enhanced Business Models (Foundation) 🎯 CURRENT

**Goals**: Create robust business models with conversion methods and business logic

#### 1.1 Enhance `CommitInfo` with Conversion Methods ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Add `to_db_create(repository_id: int) -> CommitCreate`

- [ ] **Milestone 4**: AI-ready foundation complete

### Current Session Status

**Session Start**: 2025-07-17
**Phase**: 1.1 - Enhance CommitInfo with Conversion Methods
**Branch**: `feature/data-model-architecture` (to be created)
**Current Focus**: Setting up implementation tracking and beginning conversion methods

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Model Duplication Risk
**Risk**: Business and database models share similar fields
**Mitigation**:
- Explicit conversion methods make field mapping clear
- Automated tests for conversion completeness
- Shared base models where appropriate

### Manager Complexity Risk  
**Risk**: Manager coordination becomes complex
**Mitigation**:
- Start simple, add complexity gradually
- Clear transaction boundaries
- Comprehensive integration tests

### Performance Risk
**Risk**: Conversion overhead and multiple database queries
**Mitigation**:
- Profile after implementation, optimize hot paths
- Batch operations where possible
- Lazy loading patterns for expensive operations

### Testing Overhead Risk
**Risk**: Multiple layers increase testing complexity
**Mitigation**:
- Use factory patterns for test data
- Test each layer independently
- Focus on business logic and integration points

## Implementation Guidelines

### Code Quality Standards
- Follow `ai/memory/ai-style-guide.md` rigorously
- Module-only imports (e.g., `pathlib.Path`, not `from pathlib import Path`)
- Comprehensive type hints using modern Python 3.10+ syntax
- Test-driven development approach
- 100% test pass rate before any commits

### Conversion Method Pattern
```python
# Business → Database
def to_db_create(self, repository_id: int) -> CommitCreate:
    """Convert business model to database creation model."""
    return CommitCreate(
        repository_id=repository_id,
        sha=self.sha,
        # ... explicit field mapping
    )

# Database → Business  
@classmethod
def from_db_model(cls, db_commit: Commit) -> "CommitInfo":
    """Convert database model to business model."""
    return cls(
        sha=db_commit.sha,
        # ... explicit field mapping
    )
```

### Manager Pattern Template
```python
class DomainManager:
    def __init__(self, dependencies: Dependencies):
        self._dependencies = dependencies

    async def primary_operation(self) -> BusinessResult:
        """Main operation with business logic."""
        # 1. Load/generate business objects
        # 2. Apply business logic  
        # 3. Persist via conversion + repositories
        # 4. Return business result
```
