## What is Ca-Bhfuil?

**Ca-Bhfuil** *(pronounced "caw will")* is a git repository analysis tool designed for open source maintainers. The name means "where is?" in Irish, reflecting the tool's purpose of helping maintainers locate commits across complex git histories.

## Core Problem

Open source maintainers need to track commits across multiple stable branches:
- Find where CVE fixes have been backported
- Identify what's missing from stable branches  
- Understand commit distribution across git history
- Track security patches and critical fixes

## Solution Approach

A local-first, high-performance tool that:
- Uses pygit2 for 10x+ performance over GitPython
- Stores everything locally with SQLite
- Provides rich CLI interface with Typer
- Integrates optional AI analysis capabilities
- Maintains privacy with local-only operations

## Current Development Phase

**Status**: Core implementation phase
- âœ… Design complete with comprehensive architecture
- âœ… Bootstrap complete with Python package structure
- âœ… Configuration foundation implemented
- ðŸ”„ Repository management and git operations (current focus)

## Key Architectural Principles

1. **Local-First**: All operations work offline with local SQLite storage
2. **Performance-Focused**: Designed for repositories with 10k+ commits
3. **Privacy-Preserving**: No required external services or data sharing
4. **AI-Enhanced**: Optional local AI integration for commit analysis
5. **Standards-Compliant**: XDG Base Directory compliance on Linux

## Technology Foundation

- **Git Operations**: pygit2 (LibGit2 bindings) for performance
- **Storage**: SQLite with diskcache for everything
- **CLI**: Typer with Rich for beautiful terminal output
- **AI Integration**: PydanticAI with local models (Ollama/vLLM)
- **Configuration**: Pydantic v2 with YAML files

## User Workflow

1. **Configure repositories**: Add git repositories to track
2. **Sync and analyze**: Download/update repositories and analyze commits
3. **Search and query**: Find commits by SHA, pattern, or semantic meaning
4. **Cross-reference**: Understand commit relationships across branches
5. **Generate reports**: Export findings for documentation or further analysis

## Success Metrics

- **Performance**: Sub-second search in 10k+ commit repositories
- **Usability**: Intuitive CLI that matches maintainer mental models
- **Reliability**: Handles large repositories without memory issues
- **Privacy**: Zero external dependencies for core functionality
